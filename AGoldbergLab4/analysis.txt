Performance:
Quicksort:

a. When the first item of the partition is used as a pivot, Quicksort performs poorly on sorted and reverse-sorted datasets due to the partition imbalance. However, it performs well on random datasets.

b. When insertion sort is used for partitions of size 100 or less, the performance of Quicksort improves, especially for smaller datasets. This is because insertion sort is faster than Quicksort for smaller datasets.

c. When insertion sort is used for partitions of size 50 or less, the performance is further improved, although the difference is marginal compared to using a partition size of 100.

d. When the median-of-three is used as a pivot, the performance of Quicksort significantly improves on sorted and reverse-sorted datasets. This is because the median-of-three pivot selection method results in a more balanced partition.

Natural Merge Sort:

Using a linked implementation, Natural Merge Sort performs consistently across different datasets, showing no noticeable difference between random, sorted, and reverse-sorted data.

Efficiency:
Time complexity:

Quicksort:

a. First item as pivot: Average case - O(n log n), Worst case - O(n^2)
b. Insertion sort for partitions of size 100 or less: Average case - O(n log n), Worst case - O(n^2)
c. Insertion sort for partitions of size 50 or less: Average case - O(n log n), Worst case - O(n^2)
d. Median-of-three as pivot: Average case - O(n log n), Worst case - O(n log n)

Natural Merge Sort:

Average case - O(n log n), Worst case - O(n log n)

Space complexity:

Quicksort: O(log n) - due to recursive calls on the stack
Natural Merge Sort (linked implementation): O(n) - due to the need for additional linked lists

Impact of factors:
a. Order of data: Quicksort's performance is heavily affected by the order of the data, especially when using the first item as a pivot. Natural Merge Sort is not affected by the order of the data.

b. Size of file: Both algorithms perform well on large datasets, with Quicksort showing better performance when the median-of-three pivot selection method is used.

c. Choice of pivot selection and partition size: The choice of pivot selection and partition size greatly affects the performance of Quicksort. Using the median-of-three pivot selection method results in the best performance.

d. Use of Natural Merge Sort: Natural Merge Sort provides consistent performance across different datasets, making it a reliable choice when the order of the data is unknown or cannot be controlled.

Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Quicksort with the median-of-three pivot selection method is the most efficient in terms of time complexity. However, Natural Merge Sort provides consistent performance across different datasets and is more space-efficient when using a linked implementation. Thus, the choice of algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as the importance of space efficiency, the predictability of the input data, and the need for a consistent performance.
