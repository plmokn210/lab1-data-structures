To implement the Huffman Encoding Tree in Python, we can follow these steps:

1. Read the frequency table from the given file.
2. Create the Huffman Tree based on the frequency table.
3. Preorder traversal of the Huffman Tree.
4. Encode the input strings using the generated Huffman Tree.
5. Decode the given encoded strings using the Huffman Tree.

Here's the implementation:

```python

```

You can now run the program using the provided `FreqTable.txt`, `ClearText.txt`, and `Encoded.txt` files.

For the analysis part, you'll want to consider the following factors:

1. Compare the compression efficiency of Huffman encoding versus conventional encoding schemes.
2. Evaluate how different tie-breaking schemes affect the compression ratio.
3. Discuss the data structures used in the implementation (heap, tree, dictionary) and their impact on the program's efficiency.

You can then use the analysis as a basis for your final report on this assignment.
